      <h2>Blog</h2>
      <h3>Blogpost #1</h3>
      <p>Hello, today I've started to create my own webpage from scratch. Now trying to organize different sections and think how to visually place them. </p>
      <h3>Post of 19.07.22.</h3>
      Today I changed the design of the home page a bit. The sections are no longer all in one page, but links lead to different sections, 
        with all of the sections referenced as links in the upper toolbar. </br> 
        Also added a footer with a few links too.</br>  
       To be refined: link location in the page, styling in general, purpose of the footer. </br>
      Start to inlude content. </p>

      <h3>Blogpost #3</h3>
      <p>Learnings 3</p>
    </br>
  </br>

      <h3>DONE</h3>
      _add checklist items here_
      <p>w h a t's d o n e</p>
      <p> - Organized titles by section </br>
        - added links, that lead to each section </br>
        - added content for each respective section </br>
    </p>

      <h3>TO DO</h3>
       _add checklist items here. Would be cool if, once done, the item would move from here to the 'DONE' part in this page_
       _link to the TO DO list in the READ ME.md file in Github (?)_ </br>
    </br>
      2. Center the sections </br>
    3. Add some styling, to make it more appealing to the eye. </br>
    4. Make the footer purposeful </br>
    5. Noformulƒìt ko es vƒìlƒìtos turpinƒÅt </br>
    6. Work on CSS and JS file basics for this page. </br> 
    7. Put the "< n a v > < / n a v >" in the correct spot in html </br>
	  8. Work on a solution how make titles vs links look better (not duplicate) </br> 
    9. Make each section visible by scroll, but also available straight away by pressing on the link.
