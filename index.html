    <!-- Styling to be added later -->
    <p class="text-center text-blue-700">Hi, just trying to set up my own website. This is a test page for now.
      <br/>
    The purpose of this page is to try out new skills in web development and show them off in this page. This way, I will be able to track my progress and receive feedback, if the page is shared. 
    <br/> 
    In the future, a web-shop could be included as a section of this site, or as a new page. When my skill level has reached the necessary to create one.

      _maybe also live timer, to see how much time is invested since the start
      of the page_
