## To Do List
- here you can write down your To Do's
- This README.md is a markdown file
- You recognize a markdown file either by its syntax (the "##" for example) or by its file extension .md
- usually it is a best practice to keep a README file in your repo where you can document all kind of stuff
- check out other repos, like this one, and have a look at their README files
- markdown is not a programming language, more like a documentation language (Evernote actually also is working like a markdown file)
- find here a helpful overview of the most common markdown syntax commands: [Markdown Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
- markdown is often used within the DEV Scene, for example for writing documentation or to just write a blog
