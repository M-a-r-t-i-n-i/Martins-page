## To Do List
- from now on you can document your progress here
- or write down your To Do's
- or tell a joke
- or do all those things
- this README.md is a markdown file
- you recognize a markdown file either by its syntax (the "##" for example) or by its file extension .md
- usually it is a best practice to keep a README file in your repo where you can document all kind of stuff
- check out other repos, like this one by [Google for a 11ty starter repo](https://github.com/google/eleventy-high-performance-blog), and have a look at their README files
- bonus tip: 
  - usually you see the rendered markdown file = no special markdown syntax visible
  - to see the "raw" version of a markdown file in a github repo you can open the markdown file and select "raw" in the upper right corner of the mask
- markdown is not a programming language, more like a documentation language (Evernote actually also is working like a markdown file)
- find here a helpful overview of the most common markdown syntax commands: [Markdown Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
- markdown is often used within the DEV Scene, for example for writing documentation or to just write a blog
