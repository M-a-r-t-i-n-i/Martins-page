# Martins-page

## Go Live!

[Martin's page](https://m-a-r-t-i-n-i.github.io/Martins-page/)

For the beginning you'll probably do not need to bother finding a domain, buying it, looking for a hosting provider (strongly recommend netlify though) and so on.
You can just use your Github account to launch your project and have it live on the Web!
Follow those [instructions provided by Github](https://pages.github.com/) and you should have your site online in a few minutes.

Additional info when following the Github Pages introduction (meaning the link above):

- Select "Project site"
- Select "Start from scratch"

## Additional info from Lars

- from now on you can document your progress here
- or write down your To Do's
- or tell a joke
- or do all those things
- this README.md is a markdown file
- you recognize a markdown file either by its syntax (the "##" for example) or by its file extension .md
- usually it is a best practice to keep a README file in your repo where you can document all kind of stuff
- check out other repos, like this one by [Google for a 11ty starter repo](https://github.com/google/eleventy-high-performance-blog), and have a look at their README files
- bonus tip:
  - usually you see the rendered markdown file = no special markdown syntax visible
  - to see the "raw" version of a markdown file in a github repo you can open the markdown file and select "raw" in the upper right corner of the mask
- markdown is not a programming language, more like a documentation language (Evernote actually also is working like a markdown file)
- find here a helpful overview of the most common markdown syntax commands: [Markdown Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
- markdown is often used within the DEV Scene, for example for writing documentation or to just write a blog

## To Do List

1. add checklist items here.

- Center the sections
- Add some styling, to make it more appealing to the eye.
- Make the footer purposeful
- Noformulēt ko es vēlētos turpināt
- Work on CSS and JS file basics for this page.
- Put the "< n a v > < / n a v >" in the correct spot in html
- Work on a solution how make titles vs links look better (not duplicate)
- Make each section visible by scroll, but also available straight away by pressing on the link.
- Add a TO DO section in the Blog page of the site. Would be cool if, once done, the item would move from here to the 'DONE' part in that page.
